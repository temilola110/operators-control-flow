1) List the symbols for each of the below Javascript operators
Arithmetic Operators - 
a) Addition Operator (+)
b) Subtraction Operator (-)
c) Multiplication Operator (*)
d) Division Operator (/)
e) Remaider Division Operator or Modulo Operator (%)
f) Exponentiation Operator (**)
g) Increment Operator (++)
h) Decrement Operator (--)

Assignment Operators - (=)
a) Addition assignment (+=)
b) Subtraction assignment (-=)
c) Multiplication assignment (*=)
d) Division assignment (/=)
e) Remaider assignment(%=)
f) Exponentiation assignment (**=)
 


Comparison Operators
a) greater than (>)
b) greater than or equal to (>=)
c) less than (<)
d) less than or equal to(<=)
e) equality Operator (===)
f) Not equals Operator (!==)

Logical Operators -
a) Logical AND Operator (&&)
b) Logical OR Operator (||)
c) Logical NOT Operator (!)

Bitwise Operators -
a) bitwise AND (&)
b) bitwise inclusive OR (|)
c) bitwise XOR (^)

2) For each JavaScript Operator, write 2 examples.
a)Arithmetic Operators example (x+y), (a*b)
b)Assignment Operators example (b = 20;//20 ), (a += 14; // a = a+14)
c)Comparison Operators example (x > y) (a < b)
d)Logical Operators example (x && y) (a || b)



4) What is the result when the following program is executed?
for ( let i = 1; i < 20; i += 7;)
{console.log(i);} answer= i is equal to 1, 8, 15
